## How to use:

Be sure, you have installed all dependencies and applications to run React Native project on your computer : [Getting Started with React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started).

Beware that I made this project running only on Android due to lack of Apple computer.

### Running the project

Clone this repository :

```
git clone https://github.com/radandevist/utimer
cd utimer
```

Install packages :

```
npm install
```

When installation is complete, run with version of your choice :

```bash
react-native run-android
# or
react-native run-ios
```

Otherwise, you could also like to test directly the [**releases apks**](https://github.com/radandevist/utimer/releases/tag/alpha).

## Further improvements:

* Notification when the timer completes

* idk, etc, ...
